# CSharpPlayground

## About the Solution
This Visual Studio solution is a collection of CSharp projects for my own benefit. I've written production C# code since 2009. Primarily, this code has been for ASP.NET websites and web applications.

## A Little Bit About C#
C# (see sharp) is an object-oriented and type-safe language. It is Microsoft's C style language that is very similar to Java, C, C++, etc. One thing to point out with C# is that it is more than just OOP; it is component-focused. Components are self-contained and self-describing in terms of functionality.

## These Particular C# Projects
Many of the tiny projects in this solution are component-focused or focused on a simple language feature. Some of them show alternative ways to solve the same problem; like the FizzBuzz solutions. Others are simply there to reinforce harder concepts into my brain. If you find them helpful, that's cool. If not, that's OK too.
